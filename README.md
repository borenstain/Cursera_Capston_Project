# Cursera_Capston_Project
July 13, 2020

This notebook is a final project of the IBM Coursera Machine learning with Python, classification algorithms, that we learned and practiced.

Task is to predict the ability of a person Wto pay-off a loan he is asking for upon collection, based on a dataset collected of past loans.
We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

Algorithms used are:
K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression

We evaluate the models and results on a test-set using: Jaccard,	F1-score, and LogLos.
